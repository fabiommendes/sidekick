Perform a simultaneous groupby and reduction.

The computation ``result = reduceby(key, binop, seq, init)`` is equivalent to 
the following::

    def reduction(group):           
        return reduce(binop, group, init)

    groups = groupby(key, seq)                                  # doctest: +SKIP
    result = valmap(reduction, groups)                          # doctest: +SKIP

The former does not build the intermediate groups, allowing it to operate in 
much less space.  This makes it suitable for larger datasets that do not fit 
comfortably in memory

The ``init`` keyword argument is the default initialization of the
reduction.  This can be either a constant value like ``0`` or a callable
like ``lambda : 0`` as might be used in ``defaultdict``.

Usage:

    >>> from operator import add
    >>> iseven = (lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
    >>> reduceby(iseven, add, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    {False: 9, True: 6}
