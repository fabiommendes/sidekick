Roadmap
=======

Sidekick is still a Beta-quality library in the sense that the API isn't stable and there
are a few bugs lurking (but then, as with all code). Some parts of the library are stable
and are very unlikely to change. If you plan to use Sidekick, please contact the authors,
inform about your usage and contribute to this roadmap.
