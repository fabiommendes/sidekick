Installation instructions
=========================

Sidekick can be installed using pip::

    $ python -m pip install sidekick

This command will fetch the archive and its dependencies from the internet and
install them. 

If you've downloaded the tarball, unpack it, and execute::

    $ python setup.py install --user

You might prefer to install Sidekick system-wide. In this case, skip the ``--user``
option and execute as superuser by prepending the command with ``sudo``.

Windows users may find that these command will only works if typed from Python's
installation directory.

Some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) install Python without installing pip.

get-pip.py script at https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and execute it as
``python get-pip.py --user``.
